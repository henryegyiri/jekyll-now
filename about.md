Hi, Henry Ampiah here. This website (blog) explores the intuitive aspects of economic problems. My goal is to make economics approachable and relatable, starting with the intuition behind the issues we face, using high-quality and accurate research with real statistical data.

Visitors are encouraged to leave comments—your feedback will help me bridge knowledge gaps and eliminate biases. In the future, I plan to integrate both the qualitative and quantitative aspects of economics and econometrics into my posts.


### More Information

I have a strong interest in economics, data analysis, international relations, and justice, with a passion for making complex ideas accessible to everyone. My academic background and personal curiosity drive me to explore both the theoretical and practical sides of economic issues.

On this blog, you’ll find:
- Insights into economic concepts explained in simple, intuitive ways
- Occasional deep dives into data and econometric methods
- Reflections on current events and their economic implications

Outside of economics, I enjoy exploring new ideas (sometimes unconventional ones), learning skills beyond my discipline—such as how I built this website—and connecting with people who share a curiosity for how the world works. If you have suggestions, questions, or want to collaborate, feel free to reach out!
